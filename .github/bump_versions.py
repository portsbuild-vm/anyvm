# bump_versions.py -- propagate human-cut anyvm-org/<os>-builder releases
# into this repo: bump DEFAULT_BUILDER_VERSIONS in anyvm.py, extend the
# per-OS test workflow matrices, and mirror coverage.allow suffix rules
# onto new tags.
#
# Run from the anyvm repo root:
#   python3 .github/bump_versions.py [--check]
#
# --check prints what it would do and never touches the disk.
#
# Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-version-bump-bots-design.md in
# the anyvm-org tree (Bot 2). Every edit is TEXTUAL and line-scoped:
# the DEFAULT_BUILDER_VERSIONS entry line, the matrix `release: [...]`
# line, and appended coverage.allow lines. Comments, matrix excludes and
# everything else survive byte-identically; an unrecognized shape is
# skipped with a warning, never guessed at. coverage.yml independently
# re-checks the result, so a missed surface goes red with a name, not
# silent.

    - a list that is empty or contains "" is a SENTINEL (freebsd's

    - a job whose newest base release is OLDER than the file-wide newest
      is FROZEN (openbsd's testold deliberately pins 7.3-7.6) and is
      never touched -- only jobs already tracking the newest release
      keep tracking it;
    - a release missing on any of the job's arches ("" = x86_64) is not
      added and is named in the notes: the hand-written exclude that
      would make it fit stays a human call.

    Variant members mirror the current list: if the job lists
    `26.1-xfce` next to `26.1` (ghostbsd's real matrix), a new base
    `27.0` brings `27.0-xfce` along when the index ships it -- desktop
    or not; the job's own content defines its variant policy.

    Only the release line's bracketed list is rewritten; every other
